- the core integrates into a hexgon tile grid to tap into power and abilities
- player starts with a core tile only
- player is awarded tile--upgrades at various level milestones (via grid manage ui)
- player picks the tile location (based on placement rules) and the desired tile-type
- player makes decision about what type of tile to add (tile type has unique bonuses, defense, attack, passive)
- tiles animate as core uses their provided bonuses
- enemy waves spawn and attack the core (ranged or melee)

General
- Core-Upgrades can either persist, or points refunded on Core death, thus player can reroll
- Tile-Type choices should affect play style, thus lots of unique options can be added, but balance to be considered to avoid spammin.
- Unclear what player will be doing as game plays out. Will they have active enjoyable duties or will watching waves playout be rewarding with ocasional Core-Upgrade and Type-Type selection opportunities
- What exactly is the theme/story behind this game?
- Where are the enemies coming from and why are they attacking the core?
- What are the milestones that award Core-Upgrade and Tile-Upgrade points
