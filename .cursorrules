Cursor Rules

- @docs/spec.md
  - Source of truth for high-level vision, scope, and constraints. Keep changes aligned with this spec.

- @docs/hive-tiles.md
  - Follow the visual-only tile system. Tiles must not impact gameplay; treat them as VFX driven by events.

- ECS architecture (see README for directory structure)
  - Use Entity-Component-System patterns as organized in `src/ecs` and related folders.
  - Keep logic in Systems, data in Components, identities in Entities. Avoid cross-coupling.

- Configuration (no magic numbers / no hardcoding)
  - Create typed config files for all tunable values (damage, speeds, visuals, spawn rates, etc.).
  - Place configs under relevant `configs` folders and inject via constructors or factories.
  - Prefer named constants and config objects over inline literals.

- @docs/meta-upgrades.md
  - Definitions and rules for meta upgrades (MVP + backlog). Use as reference.
