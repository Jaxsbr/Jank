# Bug List

## Broken

- Tank enemy shows red color when applying stun effect (should not change color)

## Improve

### Visual/UI

- Stun effect on enemies not clear (show floating thunderbolt icon)
- Center tile loses 3d look while showing range attack effect (looks flat)
- Meta upgrades not clearly indicating purchased upgrades (fix typo: "purchaced" -> "purchased")

### Meta Progression System

- Meta progression balance: Can get stuck if unable to progress. Need per-session currency that persists across runs to purchase unlocked meta upgrades. Players should be able to earn currency by replaying to gradually unlock available upgrades.

### Wave Session

- Wave difficulty scaling: Make waves/rounds progressively more difficult
- Wave transitions: Show upgrade menu between waves
- Wave replay: Allow replaying easier waves
- Currency persistence: Death should wipe per-session currency but keep unlocked meta upgrades
